Pungi
An anaconda based installation spin tool

This project is aimed at making a public / free tool to spin installation
trees/isos of Fedora.  It will be written in python (for many obvious
reasons).  Code style I hope will be of a simple "master" process that can
call any number of subprocesses depending on a configuration set.

Thoughtspace:
We'll need to do five basic tasks:
  1) Gather packages from repos into a directory tree
  2) Run anaconda tools (buildinstall) on said directory tree
  3) Split tree into CD iso size chunks
  4) Create isos of the chunks
  5) Sanity check the tree

Gathering Packages
  See gather/PLAN

Running Anaconda Tools
  See pungi/PLAN

Split Tree Into CD Size Chunks
  See pungi/PLAN

Create Isos of the Chunks
  See pungi/PLAN

Sanity Check the Tree
  This could/should be an ever growing set of post-tree build sanity checks.
  Hopefully it'll cut down on brown paperbag trees sneaking out.

Organization
  Each task set will be its own module.  Work on each module can be done
  independantly and hopefully once functional it should be easy to tie them
  all together (one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them)

  gather/ is the module for repoclosing and downloading a set of packages.
  pungi/ is the module for running anaconda tools against a set of packages
         and creating isos
  tests/ This directory holds some files that are useful for testing
         functionality of the code.

Making it all happen
  There really is space for two tools, or something inbetween.  There is the
  task of creating a repo of packages multilibbed up.  Think rawhide.  The
  second tool takes packages from said repos and makes the install and CD set.
  Working on the second tool first makes sense, as it can be used today with
  existing Core and Extras repos.  Later, tool #1 can grow from #2.
